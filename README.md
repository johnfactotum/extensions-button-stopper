# Extensions Button Stopper

A Firefox extension

---

Are you one of those people who don't use extensions or pin all extensions to toolbar? Have you ever feel annoyed when you accidentally click on the unremovable Extensions button on the toolbar, and it opens the Add-ons Manager (about:addons) page? Are you frustrated about [Bug 1778684](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1778684) not being fixed after two years? This extension will allow you to work around the problem. It does nothing except populating the Extensions button's popup with an entry. Although the Extensions is still useless, it is now far less disruptive when you accidentally click on it.
